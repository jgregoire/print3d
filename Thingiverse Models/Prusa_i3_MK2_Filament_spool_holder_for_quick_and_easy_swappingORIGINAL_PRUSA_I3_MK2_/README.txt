# Summary

A new design for the spool holder of the ORIGINAL PRUSA I3 MK2 3D PRINTER. For quick and easy swapping. Printed with no suports! 
A video can be found here: https://youtu.be/IOQ6q4xmlrQ

**UPDATE**

Clearances between the two spindle parts are increased. So no sanding should be required.

Because some people don't have access to the right size of pvc pipe. I added a new optional design for the spindle called "Spool_Holder_Spindle_Part1 and Spool_Holder_Spindle_Part2". That makes the design completely 3D printable without any need for additional hardware

It consist of 4 printed parts and one smal piece of pvc pipe. The PVC tube has a diameter of 20 mm and is 10cm long. 
If you can't find any 20mm PVC pipe. There is also an 25mm version available by mickgalt at this link: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2008183

The clearance between the PVC pipe and caps may be too large or too small. This is due to the fluctuating inner diameter of various manufacturers of PVC pipes. But some 2 part epoxy can fix that.

Note: After printing, the parts need to be cleaned up by cutting the overhanging material away.
