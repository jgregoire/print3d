# Summary

This holder was inspired by others that are around, but that had the problem of not allocating USB sticks that are wider, including the SD adapter-reader.  
This design allocates very well up to 8 USB wide sticks, and 8 SD cards of standard size, but only 5 micro-SD.  
Also added holes to prevent from dust accumulation, and reduce a little the material used to print it.  


# Instructions

Just print it in any infill density you want, it works well since 40%, or even less
