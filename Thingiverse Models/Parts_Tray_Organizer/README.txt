# Summary

I was working on some electronics projects and needed a way to wrangle all the little parts I was getting ready to use...so I put this together. 

Edit: I just added a second version of this. After using my first one a bit, I found I wanted a couple other longer bins and the walls to be just a bit higher. 

# Print Settings

Printer: PowerSpec 3D Pro
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .20
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
This is a very easy print...just use basic settings for your filament of choice. I do add a brim when I print objects that have a lot of surface area in contact with the build plate such as this. The skirt keeps the edges, and especially the corners from curling up.

# How I Designed This

This is not a complex object, but it was my first foray into Fusion360...which is an ongoing struggle, but little projects like this is how I learn.
